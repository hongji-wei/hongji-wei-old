	<p>I am a 3rd-year PhD student in <a href="https://statistics.wharton.upenn.edu/">Department of Statistics</a> at the Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania. I am fortunately advised by <a href="http://www-stat.wharton.upenn.edu/~tcai/">T. Tony Cai</a>. I am broadly interested in high-dimensional statistics and statistical learning theory, with specific interests in

        1. Transfer learning in statistics. When multiple sources of data are available and there is certain relation between different datasets, how to make use of auxiliary information existing in source data sets to help us improve statistical performance when analyzing the target data set?
    </p>
    
    <p>
        2. Distributed learning under communication constraints. When data are stored in different terminals, statistical analysis could be chanllenging with communication constraints. I am intereted in finding information-theoretical limits of statistical accuracy under different settings for distributed learning problems.
